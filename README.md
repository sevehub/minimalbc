# minimalbc

This repository provides a Typst template for creating sleek and minimalist professional business cards. 
the minimalbc function.

The function **minimalbc** allows you to customize most of the elements of the business card 

The default layout is horizontal, but it can be easily switched to a vertical layout by passing the value true to the flip argument in the minimalbc function.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the minimalbc function:

```Typst

#import "lib.typ":minimalbc

#show: minimalbc.with(
    // possible geo_size options: eu, us, jp , cn
    geo_size: "eu",
    flip:true,
    company_name: "Company Name",
    name: "First and Last Name",
    role: "Role",
    telephone_number: "+000 00 000000",
    email_address: "me@me.com",
    website: "example.com",
    company_logo: "company_logo.png",
    bg_color: "ffffff",
)


```
